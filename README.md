# Slot Machine Game

This code is a Python implementation of a slot machine game. The game is played in the terminal and prompts the user to deposit money and then spin the slot machine. The user can bet on a certain number of lines and a certain amount per line. The game then generates a random spin and checks the winnings. The net winnings (winnings - total bet) are returned to the user's balance.
